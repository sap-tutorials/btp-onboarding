# Create a "Hello-World" Kyma Function and a microservice via CLI

<!-- description -->In this tutorial, you will use Kyma CLI to create a Kyma Function and a microservice.

## You will learn

  - How to install and use Kyma CLI
  - How to create a Kyma Function
  - How to create a Kyma microservice

## Prerequisites

- You have created and set up your "SAP BTP, Kyma Environment" either manually or by Quick Account Setup.
- You have added the Serverless module to your Kyma environment.

### Required Command Line Tools

You will need 3 command line tools in order to run this tutorial:

1. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
2. [`Kubelogin`](https://github.com/int128/Kubelogin) (a Kubectl plug-in)
3. [Kyma CLI](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/04-operation-guides/operations/01-install-kyma-CLI)

**kubectl** is a Kubernetes command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API. <br>

**`Kubelogin`** is a kubectl plugin for [`Kubernetes OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens), also known as kubectl oidc-login. <br>
It calls a browser window for your authentication. <br>
It is required to access Kyma runtime in an interactive training environment, like you use here. <br>
It is not needed if you use a different Kubernetes authentication method (not part of this tutorial).  <br>
**Note:** It has to be renamed to **`kubectl-oidc_login`** as shown later in this tutorial. <br>

**Kyma CLI** is the command line interface of Kyma. <br>

And you will need a **`kubeconfig.yaml`** file. The kubectl command-line tool uses `kubeconfig` files to find the information it needs to choose a cluster and communicate with the API server of a cluster. You will create one later.

**Hint:** The "Get Started"-guide [Deploy and expose a Function](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/02-get-started/02-deploy-expose-function/) on `Kyma-project.io` describes the steps in more detail.

<br>

### Install the Command Line Tools

**Option 1:**
Follow the installation instructions, linked under "Required Command Line Tools".

**Option 2:**
For a training setup, you may also setup the required tools manually:

1. Download [kubectl latest release binary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/).
2. Download [`Kubelogin latest release`](https://github.com/int128/Kubelogin/releases).
3. Download [kyma CLI latest release](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/releases).
4. Rename `kublogin.exe` to `kubectl-oidc_login.exe`.
5. Copy the 3 files in a windows folder of your choice. E.g. `C:/tools`.
6. Add your tools folder path to your Windows environment variable `Path`  
   (either in user variables Path or system variables Path). <br>
   Hint: You can access the System Properties by searching for `environment variables` in your windows search.   <br>
7. Test your "installation". <br>
   Open a CMD or `Powershell` window. <br>
   Type `kubectl` and enter. The result should list the available commands for kubectl. <br>
   Type `kubectl version` to see the version. <br>
   Type `kyma` and enter. The result should list the available commands fro kyma CLI. <br>
   Type `kyma version` to see the version. <br>
   
8. Before you can test `Kubelogin`, you have to provide additional configuration first.

<br>

### Download the Kyma runtime kubeconfig

The kubectl tool relies on a configuration file called the **`kubeconfig`**, to configure access to the cluster. <br>
It can be obtained from both the BTP Cockpit and the Console UI. <br>
<br>

#### Option 1: obtain the kubeconfig from the SAP BTP Cockpit

1. Within your BTP account, navigate to the sub-account which has the Kyma runtime  enabled.

2. In the subaccount choose **Overview** in the navigation pane.

3. Scroll down to the Kyma Environment details

4. Choose the link next to **`KubeconfigURL`** to download the `kubeconfig`

![Kubeconfig](kubeconfig-1.png)

<br>

#### Option 2: obtain the kubeconfig from the Console UI

1. Enter the to dashboard of your Kyma runtime.

2. Log onto the Kyma runtime if required.

3. At the top-left of the Kyma runtime window you will find a drop down which displays the name of the currently connected runtime.

4. Select the drop down and choose the option Clusters Overview

![Kubeconfig](kubeconfig-2.png)

5. Choose the Download Kubeconfig icon to download the file.

![Kubeconfig](kubeconfig-3.png)

<br>

### Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable

Last but not least, set the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

**Procedure**

1. Open either a Command Prompt CMD or `Powershell` on Windows (for other operating systems, see this [blog](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-kyma-download-cli.html#75772670-a4dd-4e30-9b78-0ad810b9e28e))

2. in DOS, type set `KUBECONFIG="<KUBECONFIG_FILE_PATH>"` and Enter. <br>
   for example: **`set KUBECONFIG="C:\tools\kubeconfig.yaml"`**  <br>
   Tip: Shift+right-click the kubeconfig.yaml file to copy the path <br>

   in `Powershell` type `$ENV:KUBECONFIG="<KUBECONFIG_FILE_PATH>"` and Enter. <br>

3. Test your configuration by running this command

   **`kubectl config get-contexts`**
   
   The result shows what you just configured and should look like this:

   ```
     CURRENT   NAME                     CLUSTER                  AUTHINFO                 NAMESPACE
     *         shoot--kyma--c-2d6af59   shoot--kyma--c-2d6af59   shoot--kyma--c-2d6af59
   ```


<br>

### Verify Kubelogin and your connection

Now let's verify that the installation of `Kubelogin` was successful. 

1. Rename `Kubelogin` to **`kubectl-oidc_login`** if not done so already.

2. Run:

   `kubectl get deployments -n kyma-system` .

   > A browser window will open, and you have to authenticate yourself, if you do not have active sessions. <br>
   > If this step fails, something went wrong with your `Kubelogin` installation.
   > **Remember:** The authentication token is only valid for a limited time.


   The installation succeeded if all the Deployments returned are in status READY. The result could look like this:

   ```
   NAME                                         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   api-gateway                                  1/1     1            1           6d22h
   central-application-connectivity-validator   2/2     2            2           6d22h
   central-application-gateway                  2/2     2            2           6d22h
   cluster-essentials-pod-preset-webhook        2/2     2            2           6d22h
   ....
   ````

Congratulations!

## Create a Kyma Function with Kubectl

After you have setup your Command Line Tools for Kyma, you can now access your Kyma environment and create a Function.

Before you start, you might have to establish your connection to Kyma again.
Open CMD and run <br>
`set KUBECONFIG="C:\tools\kubeconfig.yaml"`  <br>
`kubectl get deployments -n kyma-system`   <br>
again. This requires authentication in your Kyma service and gives you a valid session.


### Create a function

1. Open CMD.

2. Choose a working folder. You will create files. For example: C:\tools .

3. Create Function <br>
   In order to create a function, run:
   ```
   kyma init function --name hello-function
   ```
   command line result: <br>
   \- Project generated in C:\tools
   
   <br>

4. Apply the function to your Kyma runtime, run:
   ```
   kyma apply function
   ```
   command line result:  
   \- Configuration loaded  <br>
   \- Function - hello-function created `
   
   
   **Note:** You have now created 3 files in your working folder:
   > config.yaml <br>
   > handler.js <br>
   > package.json <br>
   
   you may check the content of the files with your editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code). It is the same as you have seen in the Kyma Dashboard UI.
  
  <br>
  
3. To verify the function deployment, run: 
   ```
   kubectl get functions hello-function
   ```
   
   the result should be: 
   ```
       NAME             CONFIGURED   BUILT   RUNNING   RUNTIME    VERSION   AGE
       hello-function   True         True    True      nodejs14   1         4m9s
   ```
<br>
   
   
### Expose the Function   

1. Note down your cluster domain name. <br>
   To expose the function for external access, you need to create an **API Rule**, as you did with the Dashboard UI. <br>
   First, note down your cluster domain.  <br>
   Unfortunately kubectl does not know his domain. But you can find it in the **Cluster Details** of your Kyma Dashboard. <br>
   Note: `https://api.` is not part of the cluster domain name!
   
   ![Kubecluster](kubecluster-4.png)

2. Create a yaml file, which contains your API rule definition. <br>
   For example, name it `myapirule.yaml`, place it in tools folder and add the following configuration. <br>
   Replace the following values with your values: <br>
   * **name:** hello-rule2 (will be the name of the new rule. Keep it or replace it, must be unique in your cluster)
   * **host:** hello-host2 (will be the name of the new host. Keep it or replace it, must be unique in your cluster)
   * **host:** 123456789.kyma.ondemand.com (**replace it** with your cluster domain)
   * service **name:** hello-function (the name of the function you just created, you can also use another deployed function)

<br>

Example code for the `myapirule.yaml` configuration file:
```
apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1beta1
kind: APIRule
metadata:
  name: hello-rule2
  namespace: default
spec:
  gateway: kyma-system/kyma-gateway
  host: hello-host2.123456789.kyma.ondemand.com
  rules:
    - accessStrategies:
      - config: {}
        handler: allow
      methods:
        - GET
        - POST
        - PUT
        - PATCH
        - DELETE
        - HEAD
      path: /.*
  service:
    name: hello-function
    port: 80
```

Now deploy you API Rule. Run: kubectl apply -f "<path to your config file>". <br>
for example:   

```
kubectl apply -f "C:\tools\myapirule.yaml"
```
The command line result is: <br>
apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/hello-rule2 created

<br>   
   
### Verify the Function exposure

If you have [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) installed, run curl https://hello-world.$CLUSTER_DOMAIN  <br>
for example: `curl https://hello-host2.12345678.kyma.ondemand.com/`

If the deployment was successful, the command line result is: <br>
`Hello Serverless`
   
You can also execute the function from your Kyma Dashboard as described in the previous steps of this tutorial.
